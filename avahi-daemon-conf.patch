 \fBdisallow-other-stacks=\f1 Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" no other process is allowed to bind to UDP port 5353. This effectively impedes other mDNS stacks from running on the host. Use this as a security measure to make sure that only Avahi is responsible for mDNS traffic. Please note that we do not recommend running multiple mDNS stacks on the same host simultaneously. This hampers reliability and is a waste of resources. However, to not annoy people this option defaults to "no".
 .TP
 \fBallow-point-to-point=\f1 Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will make use of interfaces with the POINTOPOINT flag set. This option defaults to "no" as it might make mDNS unreliable due to usually large latencies with such links and opens a potential security hole by allowing mDNS access from Internet connections. Use with care and YMMV!
+.TP
+\fBcache-entries-max=\f1 Takes an unsigned integer specifying how many resource records are cached per interface. Bigger values allow mDNS work correctly in large LANs but also increase memory consumption.
+.TP
+\fBclients-max=\f1 Takes an unsigned integer. The maximum number of concurrent D-Bus clients allowed. If the maximum number is reached further clients will be refused until at least one existing client disconnects.
+.TP
+\fBobjects-per-client-max=\f1 Takes an unsigned integer. The maximum number of objects (entry groups, browsers, resolvers) that may be registered per client at a time. If the maximum number is reached further object creation will be refused until at least one object is freed.
+.TP
+\fBentries-per-entry-group-max=\f1 Takes an unsigned integer. The maximum number of entries (resource records) per entry group at a time. If the maximum number is reached further resource records may not be added to an entry group.
 .SH SECTION [WIDE-AREA]
 .TP
 \fBenable-wide-area=\f1 Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). Enable wide-area DNS-SD, aka DNS-SD over unicast DNS. If this is enabled only domains ending in .local will be resolved on mDNS, all other domains are resolved via unicast DNS. If you want to maintain multiple different multicast DNS domains even with this option enabled we encourage you to use subdomains of .local, such as "kitchen.local". This option defaults to "yes".
